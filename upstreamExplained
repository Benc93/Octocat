The upstream remote is the link to the project's original repository, from a clone on a local repostiory after it has been forked into a new repository. 

In other words... 

The 'origin' link is to a cloned fork of the original repository, (from a clone on local)
The 'upstream' link remains to the original repository (that was forked, and then cloned to local)
