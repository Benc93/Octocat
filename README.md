####Summary of Activity 
    
This excercise was used to consolidate GitHub skills learned during the pre-course material.  
   
The repository structure is that of two branches: 'Master' and 'answers' each containing files. These files were generated and build on my Command Line and then committed and pushed from the local repository to the Git Hub repository.  

Finally, there is a task to submit a pull request to add a simple directory and file to a Makers Academy owned repository built for the purpose. This was the very first pre-course exercise on the Makers Academy curriculum.
    
####Lessons Learned     
   
This was quite a 'join-the-dots' exercise, that had a mix of some technical activity, and some 'in your own words' definitions of some concepts that were delivered. 
   
In truth it served more to confirm knowledge already acquired, as opposed to my learning and 'new' lessons per se.
