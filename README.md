This excercise was used to consolidate Git Hub skills learned during the pre-course material.  

The repository structure is that of two branches: 'Master' and 'answers' each containing file .txt files. These files were generated and build on my Command Line and then committed and pushed from the local repository to the Git Hub repository.  

Finally, there is a task to submit a pull request to add a simple directory and file to a Makers Academy owned repository built for the purpose.
